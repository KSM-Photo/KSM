Items that can improve process

Faster internet speed --> should be charged to company expenses if working from home.
Backup system --> to remove fear that any project related data will be lost, either external hard drives or cloud backup
Part of any event agreement --> never provide the raw images always clarify that there will be an additional expense when requesting raw data either video or pictures
Workstation --> either need a portable workstation on which major work will take place that requires faster processing or a larger display or a powerful desktop with a battery backup
Battery backup --> would need a UPS system that will allow the router and computer to run
Source control --> all data should be revision controlled, use github etc?
project management --> appropriate tools in place to handle scheduling and accounting
templates --> customer responses, agreements, new employee's and overall structure templates should be in place to make everything quicker
outside help --> interns, event help should always be encouraged
business trademark --> everything should be legally binding at some point
